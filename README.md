# Project Description:
This is a copycat Wordle GUI application created using Java and the JavaFX library. The game works exactly like the popular NYT game, however, instead uses words related to computer science. 
Download the zip file and unzip it into a directory of your choosing. Then, open up the command line and cd into the chosen directory.
Then, type in this command : javac --module-path javafx-sdk-11.0.2/lib/ --addmodules=javafx.controls Jordle.java 
and hit ENTER. This command compiles all the Java files for the project, and gives the project proper access to the JavaFX libraries. 
Then, type this command into the command line: java --module-path javafx-sdk-11.0.2/lib/ --addmodules=javafx.controls Jordle.java   and hit ENTER. A window will pop up with the game loaded and ready.
You can navigate to different windows by using the designated buttons. There are two main windows, the game window, and the HELP window with game instructions.
